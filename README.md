Amateur percussive-like-sounds recognizer

Developing this little project mainly for educational purposes - however if it's going to get functional then who knows what might happen. 
Currently working on automation of data mangling/labelling to prepare for bigger data inserts (lot's of small acoustic events happens when a drummer is playing a song)
Since I'm also learning some ML, I'll test different popular algos to see how much accuracy is there on predicting different datasets etc.
